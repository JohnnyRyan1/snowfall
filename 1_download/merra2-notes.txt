Atmospheric reanalysis download notes

MERRA-2 Version 5.12.4 is NASA's latest product

M2T1NXFLX: Surface flux diagnostics e.g. snowfall, wind speed
M2T1NXRAD: Radiation diagnostics e.g. downward shortwave and longwave radiation, surface albedo
M2T1NXSLV: Commonly used meteorology diagnostics e.g. 2 m air temperature, humidity
M2T3NXGLC: Land ice surface diagnostics e.g. surface albedo

*You might check if surface albedo in M2T1NXRAD and M2T3NXGLC are the same.*

Time resolution: preferably 1 hour
